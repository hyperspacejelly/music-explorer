# Music Explorer V1.0

This repository is for the UI part of a personal project of mine. The project is made of 3 parts : 
- A database of music albums (with title, release year, artist name, tags, link to album cover).
- A custom PHP api that lets me search through it, sort it, login to an account and bookmark albums.
    (this includes a script that fetches the track list for the album by scraping [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/)).
- **A React/Typescript UI to display and interact with the data.**

## The Components

- **\<UserSection\>** Display the user's display name and lets them change it. Also lets you elect to receive the newsletter of new additions.
- **\<Navbar\>** Handles all searching and sorting of the data. Calls to the API originate here and the results are passed up to the <App /> component for use in other components.
- **\<Table\>** Displays the album data as rows of album covers with text information overlayed. Tags are displayed on hover.
- **\<HighlightModal\>** A modal that opens up when an album from **\<Table\>** is clicked. It attempts to fetch the tracklist from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/). Contains all the information about the album. Contains the like button to bookmark an albu or remove from it from bookmarks.
- **\<CreateAccountForm\>** lets whoever has an admin account create an account by using their own login/pwd as an extra security.
- **\<LoginForm\>** is self explanatory.

## Responsive Design

Music Explorer functions just as well on mobile as it does on desktop!
